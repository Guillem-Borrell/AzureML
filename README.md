# Azure Machine Learning devops

This repository contains code and notes about how to do decent devops with Azure Machine Learning. This is an experiment executed before the final client engagement, that wanted us to guide them to make data scientists productive in this managed setup.

I've created a free tier subscription in Azure with the following components:

* Azure Machine Learning
* Azure Container Registry
* Azure Key Vault
* Azure Storage Account
* Azure Application Insights
